- Write and package docs
- Write and package unit tests
  - esp. Blivet.shouldClear
- Example programs
- API stability
- normal (non-install) operating mode
  - don't try to teardown devices that are in use
  - don't teardown any devices that were active when we found them?
  - allow multiple calls to processActions
- aynschronous actions
- event handling
- snapshot support
- support for managing container member set
- API for managing fstab and crypttab
- modularize newDevice by operation
- scan in ignored disks (maybe not all children?) and then hide them
  - otherwise they won't be visible in the storage spoke if ignored via
    via ks.cfg
- improve interaction with the environment
  - detect mounts, active swaps, &c
  - stop disabling udev-related activation
  - improve detection of active devices and associated error
    handling
- figure out how to get fwraid and multipath detected and activated outside of
  anaconda
  - REMOVE MULTIPATH CONFIG GENERATION CODE
  - open a bug against device-mapper-multipath
    - include our blacklist and notify them that we're going to
      start using their stock config post-f18 and that any bugs will
      be reassigned to them
      - include the default config via lorax and let 62-multipath.rules handle
        multipath
- raid level data type
  - constants with string representations for all device types
  - disk space function/method
    - optional chunk size, member metadata size, &c
- improve clarity of exceptions raised
- btrfs
  - raid10 needs four disks
  - detection of btrfs raid level, compression
- md name collisions in existing system
- add StorageConfigurationError or similar so autopart failures due to the
  sanity check can be handled by offering the option of keeping the layout to
  attempt to fix the problem instead of always resetting
- explicitly find and deactivate devices built on disks/partitions we're going
  to clear?
- resize luks
- check for read-only before trying to use disks
